# Local Path Provisioner Configuration for Kubespray
# This enables the local-path provisioner StorageClass which is required for
# MinIO and PostgreSQL PVCs in the MLOps stack.
#
# The local-path provisioner creates persistent volumes using local storage
# on worker nodes, which is ideal for development and testing environments.
#
# Reference: https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner
# Kubespray variable: local_path_provisioner_enabled

# Enable local-path provisioner
local_path_provisioner_enabled: true

# Storage class name (must match PVC storageClassName)
local_path_provisioner_storage_class: "local-path"

# Set as default storage class (optional, but recommended for local clusters)
local_path_provisioner_is_default_storageclass: "true"

# Reclaim policy (Delete means volumes are deleted when PVC is deleted)
local_path_provisioner_reclaim_policy: Delete

# Base directory for persistent volumes on worker nodes
local_path_provisioner_claim_root: /opt/local-path-provisioner/

# Namespace for the provisioner
