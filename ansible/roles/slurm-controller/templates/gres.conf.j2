# GPU detection happens on compute nodes.

# GPU Detection Methods (SLURM 24.11+):
# - AutoDetect=nvidia : Built-in detection, NO libraries required (recommended)
# - AutoDetect=nvml   : Requires libnvidia-ml linked at compile time (MIG/NVLink support)
#
# Using AutoDetect=nvidia which is built-in and works out of the box.

# Automatically detect NVIDIA GPUs using built-in detection
# This does NOT require NVML library to be compiled into SLURM
AutoDetect=nvidia
