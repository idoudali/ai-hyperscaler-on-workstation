# Hyperscaler on Workstation

An automated approach to emulating advanced AI infrastructure on a single workstation using KVM,
GPU partitioning, and dual-stack orchestration.

## Quick Start

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) for code quality. To get started, you need to install the hooks.

### Pre-commit Setup

1.  **Install pre-commit:**

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2.  **Install the git hooks:**

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

Now, the pre-commit hooks will run automatically on every `git commit`.

For more details, please refer to the [official pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/).
