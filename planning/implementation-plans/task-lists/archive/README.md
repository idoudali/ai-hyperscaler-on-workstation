## Why These Files Are Archived

These task lists have been moved to the archive because:

1. **All tasks are complete** - No active work remaining
2. **Historical reference only** - Valuable for understanding what was accomplished
3. **Replaced by active documents** - Current work tracked in `active-workstreams-current.md`
4. **Reduces clutter** - Keeps main directory focused on active tasks

## Current Active Documents

For current task tracking, see:

- **[../active-workstreams-current.md](../active-workstreams-current.md)** - Active tasks only
- **[../task-list-index.md](../task-list-index.md)** - Complete index with statistics
- **[../README.md](../README.md)** - Main task lists overview
