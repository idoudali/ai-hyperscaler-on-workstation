## Documentation Index Standards

**Main Index Should:**

- **Provide clear navigation** to all documentation sections
- **Highlight getting started path** for new users
- **Include quick links** to frequently needed information
- **Explain search and navigation** for finding specific content
- **Show documentation structure** so users understand organization
- **Link to all major categories** (quickstarts, tutorials, architecture, operations, troubleshooting)

**Index Structure:**

- **Hero section:** Brief overview and getting started
- **Navigation map:** Visual representation of documentation structure
- **Quick links:** Common tasks and frequently needed information
- **Category overviews:** Brief description of each documentation type
- **Search guidance:** How to find specific information

**Target Audience:**

- All users accessing documentation for any purpose
- New users looking for onboarding path
- Experienced users looking for specific information
- Contributors understanding documentation organization

**Success Metrics:**

- Users can find needed information quickly
- Getting started path is obvious to new users
- All documentation sections are easily discoverable
- Search functionality is well explained

## Integration with Documentation Categories

**Index -> All Categories:**

- Index provides entry point to all documentation
- Each category has clear navigation from index
- Index explains relationship between categories

**Index -> User Experience:**

- Index reduces time to find information
- Index provides clear learning and usage paths
- Index helps users understand system capabilities

## Final Integration

After completing TASK-DOC-7.1:

- All documentation categories are accessible from main index
- Documentation structure is complete and navigable
- Users have clear paths for learning and problem-solving
- Project has comprehensive documentation coverage

**TODO**: Create Implementation Priority Document - Timeline and phase definitions.
