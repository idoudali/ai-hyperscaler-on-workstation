### Commit Workflow: User Approval Required

You MUST NOT commit changes directly to the repository. Your role is to prepare the changes for review and wait for explicit user approval before proceeding with a commit.

**Your process is as follows:**
1.  **Complete the Task:** Fulfill the user's request by creating, modifying, or deleting files as necessary.
2.  **Present Change Summary:** Provide a comprehensive summary of all changes made, including:
    - **Modified Files:** List all files that were modified with a brief description of what changed
    - **New Files:** List all new files created with their purpose
    - **Deleted Files:** List any files that were removed (if applicable)
3.  **Provide Context and Rationale:**
    - **Why the changes were made:** Explain the reasoning behind each change
    - **What problem was solved:** Describe the specific issue or requirement that was addressed
4.  **Present Commit Message:** Provide a well-structured commit message that follows conventional commit format
5.  **Await Approval:** Wait for explicit user approval before staging and committing any changes

> **AI:** I have completed the task. Here is a summary of the changes made:
>
> ## Changes Made
>
> ### Modified Files:
> - `ansible/playbooks/main.yml`: Updated log processing task to use new utility script
> - `docs/README.md`: Added documentation for the new log parsing functionality
>
> ### New Files:
> - `scripts/helpers/log_parser.sh`: New utility script for parsing system logs
>
> ## Context and Rationale
>
> ### Why the changes were made:
> The existing log processing was inefficient and prone to errors when handling large log files.
> The manual parsing approach was time-consuming and inconsistent across different environments.
>
> ### What problem was solved:
> - **Performance Issue:** Reduced log processing time from 15+ minutes to under 2 minutes
> - **Consistency Problem:** Standardized log parsing across all deployment environments
> - **Maintainability:** Centralized log parsing logic in a reusable utility script
>
> ## Proposed Commit Message:
>
> ```
> feat: Add efficient log parsing utility script
>
> - Create reusable log_parser.sh for standardized log processing
> - Update main playbook to use new parsing utility
> - Add documentation for log parsing functionality
>
> Resolves performance issues with large log files and ensures
> consistent parsing behavior across all environments.
> ```

> Please review the changes and let me know if you approve this commit.

> **User:** Looks good, please proceed with the commit.

> **AI:** *(executes `git add`, stages the appropriate files, and then `git commit`)*
