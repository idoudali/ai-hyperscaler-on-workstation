# Markdown Formatting Standards

Follow these rules for `.markdownlint.yaml` compliance:

## Core Rules

### Headers
- Use ATX style (`#` symbols)
- Max line length: 120 characters
- No trailing punctuation

### Lists
- Use dash (`-`) for unordered lists
- Use numbers for ordered lists
- Indent with exactly 2 spaces
- Checkbox format: `- [ ]` or `- [x]`

### Code
- Use fenced code blocks with triple backticks
- Include language hints for syntax highlighting
- Use inline code for file paths, commands, variables
- Max code block line length: 120 characters

### Line Length and Spacing
- Max line length: 120 characters
- Allow 2 trailing spaces for line breaks
- No other trailing spaces

### Special Cases
- Allow inline HTML for complex tables/formatting
- Allow bare URLs in technical docs
- Allow first line to not be H1
